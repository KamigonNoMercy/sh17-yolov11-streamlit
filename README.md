# 🦺 SH17 Safety Equipment Detection (YOLOv11)

This repository contains my **YOLOv11 object detection model** trained on the 
[SH17 PPE dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mugheesahmad/sh17-dataset-for-ppe-detection) 
(created by *mugheesahmad* on Kaggle).  

👉 **Note:** The dataset belongs to the original author.  
👉 The **model training, fine-tuning, and deployment app** are my own work.
